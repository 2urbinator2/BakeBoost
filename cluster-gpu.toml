# Glean Cluster Configuration - GPU Mode
#
# This configuration is used when deploying to the cluster with GPU acceleration.
# The cluster provides AMD MI300X GPUs for deep learning workloads.
#
# Usage: ./submit-job.sh "flwr run . cluster-gpu" --gpu

[tool.flwr.federations.cluster-gpu]
# Number of bakery clients to simulate
options.num-supernodes = 5

# GPU resource allocation per client
[tool.flwr.federations.cluster-gpu.options.backend.client-resources]
num-cpus = 4  # 4 CPU cores per bakery client
num-gpus = 1  # 1 AMD MI300X GPU per client

# Note: GPU mode is useful if you implement deep learning models
# (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) instead of XGBoost for demand forecasting
