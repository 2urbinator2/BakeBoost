Comparative training on separate training data, used by the stores independently, show worse RMSE and MAE metrics. It is explained by insufficient amounts of data stored by some of the shops. Using federated learning allows the stores to accurately train the model while not directly sharing their data. 

The data distribution of all datasets shows strong weekly seasonality and therefore shows similar correlation between features and target, which allowed easy integration.
